**What is the difference between image processing and computer vision?**

Image Processing: This involves processing of an image. It means to change hue, contrast, brightness etc features of an image to make it look better.
Computer Vision: This takes an image and gives the interpretations of that image. For example, identifying an animal as cat or dog from a given image.
