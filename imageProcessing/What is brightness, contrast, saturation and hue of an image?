Contrast: The difference between lightest and darkest parts of an image. Increasing contrast simply means, making the lighter parts of the image even more light and making darker parts even more dark.
Saturation: It represents the depth or intensity of colour in an image. The more the saturation, the more vibrant or colourful the image appears.
Hue: It is an angular representation of RGB value. 0 degrees means red and then as the angle increases the frequency of light increases.
